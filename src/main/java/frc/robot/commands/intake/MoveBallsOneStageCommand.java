/**
 * Will move all of the balls one stage upon intaking one ball.
 * 
 * Each stage is decided by the amount of balls in the magazine.
 * 
 * Stage 1: (One ball)
 * Ball 1 is at entry point activating Sensor one. 
 * To move to stage 2, the entry motor and curve motor must spin until sensor two is activated.
 * 
 * Stage 2: (Two Balls)
 * Ball 1 is at curve activating Sensor two
 * Ball 2 is at entry activating Sensor one
 * To move to stage 3, the entry, curve and vertical motors must spin until sensor three is activated.
 * 
 * Stage 3: (Three Balls)
 * Ball 1 is at first level of vertical conveyor activating Sensor three
 * Ball 2 is at curve activating Sensor two
 * Ball 3 is at entry activating Sensor one
 * To move to stage 4, the entry, curve, and veretical motors must spin until sensor four is activated.
 * 
 * Stage 4: (Four Balls)
 * Ball 1 is at second level of vertical conveyor activating Sensor four
 * Ball 2 is at first level of vertical conveyor activating Sensor three
 * Ball 3 is at curve activating Sensor two
 * Ball 4 is at entry activating Sensor one
 * 
 * Stage 5: (Five Balls)
 * Ball 1 is at third level of vertical conveyor activating Sensor five
 * Ball 2 is at second level of vertical conveyor activating Sensor four
 * Ball 3 is at first level of vertical conveyor activating Sensor three
 * Ball 4 is at curve activating Sensor two
 * Ball 5 is at entry activating Sensor one
